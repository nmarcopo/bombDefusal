# Intro to Engineering Final Project: Bomb Defusal Simulator
Originally Submitted April 27, 2017 to Professor [Brian Smith](https://engineering.nd.edu/profiles/bsmith).

## Addendum:
At the time of writing this, over a year has passed since my group and I first submitted and presented this project to my Intro to Engineering class. It still stands as the most fun I've had with a programming project to date, mostly due to the chemistry of our team and the novelty of the project. Despite a few bumps early on and several all nighters close to the deadline, we pulled through and came to our demonstration day with a great project.  
I'd like to emphasize that while I am very proud of this project and all of the work we put into it, this was our FIRST experience on any large programming project, and as a result the code is *really* messy. There's plenty of unused variables, poor style, and far too few comments for a project of this size. If you have any questions about what a line of code does, what a variable means, or anything else, feel free to contact me via my website, [nick.marcopo.li](http://nick.marcopo.li).  
Thanks for checking out this project!

# Video Demonstration:
Each group was required to create a video demonstration of their project for their grader. I've linked our video below:

We also wrote up an executive summary of our project, which is just a high level overview of our work. I've included this, along with our demonstration day presentation and instruction manual, in the `res` folder of this repo.

# Instructions:
First, grab a friend and print out our instruction manual, found in the `res` folder of this repo. Don't read through it just yet! Next, run the initialMenu.m file. Click on the difficulty you'd like to play on (we recommend starting on `very easy mode`) and press `Play Game`. Have your friend open the instruction manual and read through it - your objective will become clear as your friend reads. Have fun!
